# Cybersecurity Labs & Projects 🔐

Welcome to my cybersecurity workspace.  
This repository documents my journey as I build, test, and analyze security concepts — from fundamental networking to real-world threat simulations.

---

## 🧠 About This Repository
This repo serves as my digital lab book — a mix of:
- **Hands-on labs:** Networking, ethical hacking, system hardening
- **Tool explorations:** Nmap, Wireshark, Burp Suite, Metasploit, etc.
- **Attack simulations:** Phishing, brute force, privilege escalation, and social engineering
- **Research notes:** Scam behavior analysis and detection strategies

---

## ⚙️ Current Focus
- Strengthening my foundation in **network security & Linux administration**
- Documenting **ethical hacking labs** from NIIT
- Building a **scam-exposure tool** that analyzes online fraud patterns
- Practicing **offensive and defensive techniques** in simulated environments

---

## 🧩 Tools & Technologies
- **Operating Systems:** Kali Linux, Windows Server, Ubuntu  
- **Languages:** Python, Bash, PowerShell  
- **Security Tools:** Wireshark, Nmap, Burp Suite, Hydra, JohnTheRipper  
- **Version Control:** Git & GitHub

## 🧩 Learning Goals
- Build a strong foundation in cybersecurity principles  
- Practice ethical hacking in safe, isolated labs  
- Document everything — **because clarity beats memory**  
- Transition from theory → real-world problem solving  

---

## 🚀 Future Plans
- Launch an open-source **scam-behavior detection tool**
- Earn global cybersecurity certifications (CompTIA Security+, CEH, Cisco)
- Contribute to open-source security projects and build a solid GitHub portfolio
